EPIGENESIS
----------

Use the power of distributed computing to reveal the plaintext of a given hash.

Details about the special protocol is below (#protocol).

IMPORTANT: THE SYSTEM LACKS FOR ANY AUTHENTICATION OR SECURITY FOR NOW.

The system consists of three apps:
* The cooperation server:
	1- Receives job requests and add them to the queue.
	2- Handles the Join/Depart of worker nodes.
	3- Provides information and statistics about the job queue and current tasks.
	4- Notifies worker nodes and clients when there's any update (about data, or even the program).
	5- Divides the problem (job) into sub-problems (tasks) and distributed them to clients (as intervals).

* The worker node:
	1- Receives tasks from the cooperation server.
	2- Runs the task.
	3- Provides statistics about the status when asked.
	4- Returns result upon completing the task.
	5- Accepts commands from cooperation server (i.e., abortion, new task, ...etc).

* The client:
	1- Requests jobs from cooperation server.
	2- Requests statistics.


-- The cooperation server has two interfaces (i.e., listen to 2 ports): one for clients, and the other for workers.


Protocol
--------
	We use JSON-based protocol, with the following specifications:

Server Specifications
---------------------
	1- (Authenticates - NOT IMPLEMENTED) and  Accepts clients on port: 0x7dd.
	2- Accepts worker nodes on port: 0x7c7.
